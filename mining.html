              <h1><span class="highlight3">Availible Mining Algorithms</span></h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Balkoins currently only supports Cryptonite mining algorithms. This means we specialize in Monero(XMR) mining. Monero has proven to be a very stable cryptocurrency that we have been mining for a year. In the future we plan on supporting many more mining algorithms. Although we mine only one algorithm, you may recieve Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin as your payment.</p>

            </li>

              <h1><span class="highlight3">Pricing</span></h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Your price depends on the amount of graphics cards you would like to purchase. We charge our customers the price of each graphics card, plus installation labor, as well as electricity consumed per year. Due to the many possibilities that each client may choose from, please setup a call with us in order to work out the details. Please note, a graphics cards price may fluctuaute throughout the year.</p>
            </li>

              <h1><span class="highlight3">Assembling Your Own Equipment (Local Customers Only)</span></h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are in the Southeast Michigan area, and interested in building your own mining rig, we can assist you with the tough setup process. Our team can come to your location and construct your rig from start to finish, and teach you how to maintain it and get the most out of your mining equipment. This service covers everything from choosing parts, setting up software/wallets/programs, hardware installation, and personal profitability calculations. If interested, you may hire us to perform maintenence on your rig when needed.</p>

              <h1><span class="highlight3">Maintenence</span></h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the downsides of mining is the random maintenence that needs to be performed on the cards. Shut downs are frequent issues to deal with. Your cards will never be off for longer than 24 hours and the Balkoins team will do everything we can to make sure your cards are running 24/7. One thing to keep in mind is that when your cards are down, so are ours, so it is always in our best interest to keep them operating.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <h1><span class="highlight3">Payments</span></h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Once your equipment is setup, we will need a your payment address in order to send your funds every month. Balkoins takes none of your profits. Profits depend on many variables that are beyond our control such as current mining difficulty, pool outages, and value of the currency being mined. If you choose, you may recieve Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin as your payment.</p>
